Here is a concise `README.md` you can use for this repository.

# Problem Solving Repository

Personal collection of self-solved programming challenges from platforms such as LeetCode, Codeforces, HackerRank, and Project Euler. Focus areas include data structures, algorithms, and problem-solving practice across various topics.

## Structure

- `src/main/java/henrro/problemsolving/leetcode` \- Java solutions for LeetCode.
- `src/main/java/henrro/problemsolving/codeforces` \- Java and C\+\+ solutions for Codeforces.
- `src/main/java/henrro/problemsolving/hackerrank` \- Java solutions for HackerRank.

File naming follows `Problem<id>.<ext>` (e.g., `Problem242.java`, `Problem160A.cpp`).

## Tech

- Java, C\+\+
- Maven
- macOS
- IDE: IntelliJ IDEA

## Run examples

Using IntelliJ IDEA:
- Open the project and run any file with a `main` method directly from the editor.

Terminal \- Java:
- Compile and run a single file:
    - `javac -d out src/main/java/henrro/problemsolving/leetcode/Problem242.java`
    - `java -cp out henrro.problemsolving.leetcode.Problem242`

Terminal \- C\+\+:
- `clang++ -std=c++17 -O2 src/main/java/henrro/problemsolving/codeforces/Problem160A.cpp -o run && ./run`

## Topics practiced

- Arrays, strings, hash maps, sorting
- Two pointers, greedy, prefix sums
- Binary search, stacks, queues
- Trees, graphs, DFS/BFS
- Dynamic programming, bit manipulation

## Notes

- Each solution is self-contained and optimized progressively over time.
- This repository serves as a learning log and reference for revisiting concepts and patterns.
